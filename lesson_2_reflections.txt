What happens when you initialize a repository? 
This init command sets up a respository to be tracked. This is a setup only command and one has to commit before any files are tracked. Also one has to add files before they are tracked.

Why do you need to do it?

To create the underlying files in the repository, which are mostly hidden from the user.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

The staging area is an area that holds the files that are being tracked and  committed on

What value do you think it offers?
The staging area seperates files that need to be tracked from those that do not need to be tracked.
The staging area can also seperate commits so that smaller chunks of commits can be focused on





How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
I can seperatly add files to the staging area and then perform commits on these.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized?
When I want to try experiment features, or test out something new while still retaining my original file

How would branches help?
Branches help by using the same code not not harming the master branch if so desired



How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?


It lets me know where the plsit happened and lets me see the lists of commits before the split so that I can see how code evolved


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
 the diagram the way we do?
Merging two braches merges changes from two different branches into a single branch.
The diagram shows which nodes the branches combined



What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
