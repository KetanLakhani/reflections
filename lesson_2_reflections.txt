What happens when you initialize a repository? 
This init command sets up a respository to be tracked. This is a setup only command and one has to commit before any files are tracked. Also one has to add files before they are tracked.

Why do you need to do it?

To create the underlying files in the repository, which are mostly hidden from the user.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

The staging area is an area that holds the files that are being tracked and  committed on

What value do you think it offers?
The staging area seperates files that need to be tracked from those that do not need to be tracked.
The staging area can also seperate commits so that smaller chunks of commits can be focused on
